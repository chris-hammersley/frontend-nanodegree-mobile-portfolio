        <strong>I enjoy making data-driven decisions!</strong> I spend part of my day optimizing my company's e-commerce site, where we sell online safety training. I delve into the transactional data to determine how to better reach our customers. I also get flex time to experiment with mobile app development and front-end web development in pursuit of cool ways to reach new potential customers, which I've showcased below. <br> Contact me: mediazomb@gmail.com

            <p>I'm developing a mobile phone app for Safety Supervisors. Supervisors can snap a photo of a safety violation, scan a worker's hard hat barcode, identify the hazard and report the violation. The app integrates with the company account in the LMS and generates a daily report which recommends appropriate online safety courses for the worker.</p>

            <a href="project-mobile.html">Safety Role Call</a>
            <p>I'm creating a daily toolbox safety meeting app for tablets that provides compliance reporting for the Construction Foreman who holds safety meetings on site before work begins every morning. Foreman receives safety talking points to review with work crew, shows a short video demonstrating safety techniques, snaps a picture of the work crew and takes role call. All report data is synced with the company account in the LMS.</p>

            <p>I'm building a mobile game for the construction worker. This game will engage the worker with a Safety Question-a-Day, explaining and reinforcing safety concepts that are instrumental in keeping workers safe on the job site. It will be tailored to the workers job and 30 days of correct answers wins a prize. Each month has a different theme that ties into an online course.</p>
