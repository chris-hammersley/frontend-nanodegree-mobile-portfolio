        <strong>I enjoy making data-driven decisions!</strong> I spend part of my day optimizing my company's e-commerce site, where we sell online safety training. I delve into the transactional data to determine how to better reach our customers. I also get flex time to experiment with mobile app development and front-end web development in pursuit of cool ways to reach new potential customers, which I've showcased below. <br> Contact me: mediazomb@gmail.com

            <a href="project-webperf.html">Safety Tracker Mobile App</a>
            <p>Image not representative of app. I'm developing a mobile phone app for Safety Supervisors. Supervisors can snap a photo of a safety violation, scan a worker's hard hat barcode, identify the hazard and report the violation. The app integrates with the company account in the LMS and generates a daily report which recommends appropriate online safety courses for the worker.</p>

            <a href="project-mobile.html">Safety Role Call</a>
            <p>I'm creating a daily safety meeting tablet app that provides  reporting for Construction Supervisors. Don't mind the image. The Safety Supervisor receives safety talking points to review with his/her work crew, shows a short video demonstrating safety techniques, snaps a picture of the work crew and then signs role call. All report data is synced with the company account in the LMS.</p>

            <p>I'm building a mobile game for the construction industry. Right now it's a work in progress & looks like pizza. This game will deliver a Safety Question-a-Day, explaining and reinforcing safety concepts to keep workers safe on the job site. 30 days of correct answers wins a prize! Each month's theme ties into an online course.</p>
